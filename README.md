## Description

Quantitative Methods in R for Biology is a course aimed at undergraduates at a third year level or above. 
The course covers statistics and data analysis for ecology and reproducible quantitative methods in R. 

Statistical analysis, modelling, simulation, and data analysis are essential skills for applying 
ecology concepts to data. This course is designed to meet a growing demand for reproducible, openly accessible, 
analytically thorough, and well-documented science. Students will learn to develop ecological population models, 
analyze data, and document their research using the R programming language. No prior programming experience is required.

For more detail on the course, check out the [syllabus](https://uoftcoders.github.io/rcourse/).

## Instructional Design

The lectures in this course are designed to be presented using a participatory live-coding approach.
This involves an instructor typing and running code in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) in front of the class, while the class follows
along using their own computers. Challenges are interspersed in the lesson material, allowing students to 
collaboratively work on smaller coding problems for a few minutes. All lesson materials are provided ahead
of time on the course website for students to refer to during lectures.

The bulk of the course's assessment structure involves weekly assignments. These assignments
are primarily code-based and are designed to also be completed in RStudio using the R Markdown format.

At the end of the course, students undertake a group project, wherein they attempt to address a scientific
question by applying techniques learned over the course to open ecological data. At the end of the semester,
groups present their work in a conference-style presentation, and submit a report in the style of a scientific paper. 

## Lecture Content

The course's lesson material is broadly subdivided into four main topics:

1. Introductory R (Lectures 1-6)
    * Introduces students to the R programming language, with a focus on 
      data wrangling and visualization.
2. Statistical analysis (Lectures 7-10)
    * Introduces concepts such as regression, principal component analysis, and statistical models.
3. Numerical modelling (Lectures 11-12)
    * Introduces students to numerically modelling populations in R.
4. Reproducible science (Lectures 13-15)
    * Prepares students for project work period and introduces methods for reproducible science (GitHub, R Markdown).
