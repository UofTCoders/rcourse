1.  Plotting (1 mark)

    Run the block below to create a categorical variable of the `activ`
    column. This will make dplyr recognize that there are only two
    levels of activity (0 and 1), rather than a continuous range 0-1,
    which will facilitate plotting.

    ```{r}
    library(tidyverse)
    beaver1 <- beaver1 %>%
        mutate(factor_activ = factor(activ))
    ```

    a.  In the previous assignment, we saw that the beaver's body
        temperature was the highest when the beaver was outside the
        retreat. However, we did not explore the distribution of
        temperatures for the active and inactive conditions. Create a
        histogram with the temperature on the x-axis and color the bins
        corresponding to the activity variable. *Hint: You need to use
        the `fill` parameter rather than `color`; and make sure you are
        using the correct `activ` column!* (0.25 marks)

    b.  We already know that the beaver's body temperature is correlated
        with whether it is outside the retreat or not. However, we did
        not control for the time of day, maybe the beaver's temperature
        is even better predicted by knowing what time of day it is. To
        satisfactorily answer this question, we should perform a
        regression analysis, but we easily can get a good overview by
        plotting the data. Make a scatter plot with the time of day on
        the x-axis and the body temperature on the y-axis. Color the
        scatter points according the beaver's activity level and
        separate the measurements into one plot per day. *Hint: To
        separate measurements per day, you could use `filter()` and two
        chunks of code, but try the more efficient way of facetting into
        subplots, which we talked about in the lecture.* (0.75 marks)

2.  Read in and pre-process data (1.5 marks)

    Ok, that's enough about beaver body temperatures. Now you will apply
    your data wrangling skills on the yearly change in biomass of plants
    in the [beautiful Abisko national park in northern
    Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abisko_National_Park). We have
    preprocessed this data and made [it available as a csv file via this
    link](https://uoftcoders.github.io/rcourse/data/plant-biomass-preprocess.csv).
    You can find the original data and a short readme on
    [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/Time_Series_of_plant_biomass_during_1998-2013/4149648)
    and [dryad](https://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.38s21).
    The original study[^1] is available with an open access license.
    Reading through the readme on figshare, and the study abstract will
    increase your understanding for working with the data.

    a.  Read the data directly from the provided URL into a variable
        called `plant_biomass` and display the first six rows. (0.25
        mark)

    b.  Convert the Latin column names into their common English names:
        lingonberry, bilberry, bog bilberry, dwarf birch, crowberry, and
        wavy hair grass. After this, display all column names. *Hint:
        Search online to find out which Latin and English names pair up.
        There is a function in the `dplyr` cheat sheet that might help you
        rename these columns. Finally, check the [tidyverse style
        guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#object-names) to make
        sure your new column names are formatted correctly.* (0.5 marks)

    c.  This is a wide data frame (species make up the column names). A
        long format is easier to analyze, so gather the species names
        into one column (`species`) and the measurement values into
        another column (`biomass`). Assign it to the variable
        `plant_biomass` to overwrite the previous data frame. Make
        sure you don't lose any columns in the reshaping process!
        *Hint: Make sure the output is correct before overwriting the
        old variable.* (0.75 marks)

3.  Data exploration (4.5 marks)

    Now that our data is in a tidy format, we can start exploring it!

    a.  What is the average biomass in g/m^2 for all observations in
        the study? (0.25 marks)

    b.  How does the average biomass compare between the grazed control
        sites and those that were protected from herbivores. (0.25
        marks)

    c.  Display a table of the average plant biomass for each year.
        (0.25 marks)

    d.  What is the mean plant biomass per year for the `grazedcontrol`
        and `rodentexclosure` groups (spread these variables as separate
        columns in a table). (0.5 marks)

    e.  Compare the biomass for `grazedcontrol` with that of
        `rodentexclosure` graphically in a line plot. What could explain
        the big dip in biomass year 2012? *Hint: The published study
        might be able to help with the second question...* (0.5 marks)

    f.  How many distinct species are there? (0.25 marks)

    g.  Check whether there is an equal number of observations per
        species. (0.25 marks)

    h.  Compare the yearly change in mean biomass for each species in a
        lineplot. (0.5 marks)

    i.  From the previous two questions, we found that the biomass is
        higher in the sites with rodent exclosures (especially in recent
        years), and that the crowberry is the dominant species. Notice
        how the lines for `rodentexclosure` (refer back to 3.d above) 
        and `crowberry` are of similar shape. Coincidence? Let's find out! 
        Use a facetted line plot to explore whether all plant species are 
        impacted equally by grazing. (0.75 mark)

    j.  The habitat could also be affecting the biomass of different
        species. Explore graphically if this is the case. *Hint: Think
        about how to change your dataset groupings to make this plot* 
        (0.5 marks)

    k.  It looks like both habitat and treatment have an effect on most
        of the species! Let's dissect the data further by visualizing
        the effect on each species of _both_ the habitat and treatment by
        facetting the plot accordingly. *Hint: This is a hard one! You may want 
        to explore R's documentation for ggplot's `facet_grid`* (0.5 marks)

4.  Create a new column that represents the square of the biomass.
    Display the three largest `squared_biomass` observations in
    descending order. Only include the columns `year`, `squared_biomass`
    and `species` and only observations between the years 2003 and 2008
    from the forest habitat. *Hint: Break this down into single criteria
    and add one at a time. You will be able to obtain the desired result
    with five operations.* (1 mark)
