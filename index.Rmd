title: "Syllabus: EEB430H1 Theoretical Ecology [24L, 12P]"
---

This course focuses on theoretical ecology concepts and reproducible quantitative methods using R. Theoretical ecology uses models to explain biological phenomena such as the maintenance of biodiversity, population growth, competition, eco-evolutionary dynamics, epidemiology, spatial ecology, and species extinction. This course is designed to meet a growing demand for reproducible, openly accessible, analytically thorough, and well documented science. Students will learn to develop ecological population models, analyze data, and document their research using the R programming language. No prerequisite programming experience is required.

Prerequisites: MAT 136, BIO220H1, EEB225H1, and two of EEB319H1, EEB321H1,
EEB322H1, EEB323H1

## Time

## Course Web page (on Blackboard)
All course information will be stored on Blackboard (https://portal.utoronto.ca/). You will have access to the Syllabus, Lecture Schedule & Recommended Readings for each lecture, Lab Schedule, Lab Instructions, Lecture slides (pdf files) and Lab Data sheets. If you have any problem accessing the material, let us know right away so we can fix the problem (e-mail is best).

## Recommended resources
- [R for Data science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), H Wickham, G Grolemund, 2017
    - Excellent open access resource for R.
- [Rstudio cheat sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/), Rstudio, 2017
    - As good as it sounds, great quick reference.
- [R for ecological data science](http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html)
    - An inspiration for our lectures.

## Course learning outcomes
1. Integrate and apply concepts and theoretical models learnt in class.
2. Learn how to use basic statistics to analyze and interpret data.
3. Realize that data do not always fit theoretical models, but that it is important to interpret data with a larger theoretical framework in mind.
4. Learn how to work in group on a scientific product.
5. Learn what is required to generate a scientific item ready for publishing.

## Improving your writing skills
Effective communication is crucial in science. The University of Toronto provides services to help you improve your writing (see specific section on lab reports), from general advices on effective writing to writing centers and writing courses. See http://www.writing.utoronto.ca/. The Faculty of Arts & Science also offers an English Language Learning (ELL) program, which provides free individualized instruction in English skills. Take advantage of these!

## Academic integrity:
You should be aware of the University of Toronto Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters. Also see [How Not to Plagiarize](http://advice.writing.utoronto.ca/using-sources/how-not-to-plagiarize/). Note that it is NOT appropriate to use large sections from internet sources, and inserting a few words here and there does not make it an original piece of writing. Be careful in using internet sources – there is no review of most online material and there are many errors out there. Use only academic or government internet sources when absolutely necessary. Make sure you read material from many sources (published, peer-reviewed, trusted internet sources) and that you write an original text using this information. Always cite your sources. In case of doubt about plagiarism, talk to your instructor.
