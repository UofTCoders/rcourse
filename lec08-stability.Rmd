## Recap from last week

- Drawing **phase portraits** in one dimension:

    - Fixed points: values of $N$ at which `r eq_dn_dt`, the rate of change of $N$,
    is $0$. To find fixed points, plot `r eq_dn_dt` vs. $N$ and find the place(s)
    where it crosses the $x$ axis ($y = 0$).
    - Stability: if you start at some $N$ close to the fixed point but not exactly
    on it, will you go towards (stable) or away (unstable) from the fixed point? The
    sign of `r eq_dn_dt` on either side of a fixed point tells you whether $N$ will
    increase or decrease in that area. Draw an arrow to the right if `r eq_dn_dt` is
    positive, and draw an arrow to the left if `r eq_dn_dt` is negative.

- Numerically solving differential equations in R: starting from an initial population size, 
calculate a sequence of population sizes using the information contained in the differential 
equation. The result is a **trajectory** of $N$ vs. time. 

    - **Euler's method**: starting from $N_0$, find the rate of change of $N$ given by `r eq_dn_dt` 
    evaluated at $N_0$. Approximate $N_{0 + \Delta t}$ using the following expression: 
    
    $$N_{t+\Delta t} \approx N_t + \frac{dN}{dt} \Delta t$$
    Use a `for` loop in R to calculate a series of $N$ at times of interest $t$. 
    
    - Using R's ODE-solver `ode`: define a function that calculates `r eq_dn_dt` for your model, 
    making sure that it's in the correct format with arguments `t`, `state`, and `parameters`.
    Call the function `ode` and give it the parameters `y = state, times = times, 
    func = logistic_fn, parms = parameters`
    
## Finding numerical solutions with multiple initial conditions

Let's make a pretty plot of numerical solutions for the logistic equation from a few 
different starting points.

```{r}
# define function to be in the format that `ode` uses
logistic_fn <- function(t, state, parameters) {
  # Calculates dN/dt for the logistic equation
  
  # t: time point at which to evaluate derivative
  # state: vector of variables (here it's just N)
  # parameters: vector of model parameters c(r, K)
  
  N <- state 
  
  r <- parameters['r'] # get the element labelled 'r'
  K <- parameters['K'] # get the element labelled 'K'

  #rate of change
  dN <- r * N * (1 - N / K)
    
  #return rate of change
  return(list(c(dN)))
}
```


```{r}
# Run ode

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(deSolve)

# define parameters for the ode function
parameters <- c(r = 0.5, K = 50)
initial_conditions <- seq(10, 80, by = 10)
times <- seq(0, 15, by = 0.01)

# run ode inside a loop to calculate trajectories for several initial conditions
results <- data_frame(initial_conditions = seq(10, 80, by = 10)) %>% # CTRL-shift-m to make pipe
  # 'do' is a dplyr function that returns a dataframe after doing a series of computations.
  # once the results are in a data frame, everything we've learned about ggplot and dplyr can be used!
  do(data.frame( # 'data.frame' converts the output of 'ode' to a dataframe
    ode(
      y = initial_conditions, # each time the 'do' loop runs, a new initial condition will be used
      times = times,
      func = logistic_fn,
      parms = parameters
      )
  ))

# display the first few rows of the results
head(results)  
```

This is exactly what we wanted. We have chosen a set of initial conditions 
(`seq(10, 80, by = 10)`) and created a dataframe that has one column of times (`time`)
and a column for each trajectory resulting from each initial condition (`X1`, `X2`, ...). 
Now we can use `ggplot` to plot all the trajectories.
```{r}
results %>% 
  gather(Column, Value, -time) # the minus means use all columns except that one
```

```{r}
# make a plot
library(ggplot2)

results %>%
    gather(Column, Value, -time) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = time, y = Value, color = Column)) +
    geom_line(aes(x = time, y = Value)) +
    labs(y = "Population size")
```

This plot very nicely summarizes the behaviour of the logistic equation: it shows the
path that the population size $N$ will take in time from several initial conditions. 
Importantly, the carrying capacity $K$ which we set to be $50$ is clearly a stable 
fixed point: all the trajectories go towards $K$. 

#### Challenge

Modify the plotting code above so that the legend lists the initial conditions for each
line instead of `X1`, `X2`, etc. 

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Challenge solution

results %>%
    gather(Column, Value, -time) %>%
    mutate(Column = gsub("X", "", Column) %>% # add this
    gsub("$", "0", .)) %>% # and this
    ggplot(aes(x = time, y = Value, color = Column)) +
    geom_line(aes(x = time, y = Value)) +
    labs(y = "Population size")

# or

results %>%
    rename(Condition10 = X1, Condition20 = X2) %>% # etc
    gather(Column, Value, -time) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = time, y = Value, color = Column)) +
    geom_line(aes(x = time, y = Value)) +
    labs(y = "Population size")

# or add this line before the plot

names(results) <- c('time', data.matrix(results[1, -1]))


```

## Qualitative analysis of 2D models

Now we'll move on to look at how to analyze two-dimensional models. **Two-dimensional** 
means that there are now two variables in the system (like $x$ and $y$, prey and predators) 
instead of one (like $N$).

Many of the concepts and tools from analyzing one-dimensional models will be used 
here as well, but we will add some things that are specific to more than one dimension. 

To motivate some of these new concepts and the idea of modelling in two dimensions, 
let's analyze a model of two species interacting.

$$\frac{dx}{dt} = ax - bxy$$
$$\frac{dy}{dt} = cx - dy$$

This is very close to the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model, but the term for predator 
growth is $cx$ instead of $cxy$. In this model the predators will eat the prey at a 
constant rate, no matter how many of the predators there are. Make sure you don't use 
these exact equations when you do the assignment!

First, we'll simulate a trajectory for the two species.

```{r}
predator_prey <- function(t, y, parameters) {
  # calculates dx/dt and dy/dt for a predator-prey model
  
  # t: time at which to evaluate derivatives
  # y: vector of system variables (c(X, Y))
  # parameters: vector of model parameters (c(a, b, c, d))
  
  # the arguments need to be named "t", "y", and "parameters", otherwise this won't work with phaseR, a package we will use later
    
  #now the state vector y has two elements because we have two species
  X <- y[1] # prey
  Y <- y[2] # predators
  
  a <- parameters['a']
  b <- parameters['b']
  c <- parameters['c']
  d <- parameters['d']
    
  # calculate rate of change
  dx <- a * X - b * Y * X
  dy <- c * X - d * Y
  
  # return rate of change
  return(list(c(dx, dy)))
}
```

```{r}
# run the numerical solution

parameters = c(a = 5, b = 1, c = 1, d = 0.2) # parameters named so that we can access them by name
state <- c(X = 2, Y = 2) # same thing here
times <- seq(0, 50, by = 0.01)

result <- ode(y = state, times = times, func = predator_prey, parms = parameters)
result <- data.frame(result)

```

```{r}
# plot the results

result %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = time, y = X), color = 'red') +
  geom_line(aes(x = time, y = Y), color = 'blue') +
  labs(y = "Population size")
```

It looks like we have oscillations that decay to a fixed point. Notice that the prey population 
(in red) dips below $1$ during each oscillation. If this was a real population, the prey would 
have gone extinct on the first dip below $1$. This means that the parameters we've chosen aren't
very realistic. We could instead choose parameters that would change the fixed points to real-world
population sizes. 

#### Challenge

Modify the plotting code above to include a legend distinguishing 'predators' and 'prey'. 
Feel free to look up a solution online.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Challenge solution

result %>% 
  rename(Prey = X, Predator = Y) %>% 
  gather(PredPrey, PopulationSize, -time) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = PopulationSize, color = PredPrey)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(y = "Population size")

```

### A note on using Euler's method to solve higher-dimensional systems

*Note*: if you are using Euler's method to solve a two-dimensional system, make sure 
you calculate the rates of change using the variables from the previous time step. For 
example, in the predator-prey model, both $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$ depend on $x$ and $y$, 
and it's important that you calculate $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$ *before* updating the 
values of $x$ and $y$.

Here's an example. 

```{r}
# Define predator-prey equations

dX_dt <- function(X, Y, a, b) {
  # X: number of prey
  # Y: number of predators
  # a: growth rate of prey
  # b: rate at which predators eat prey
  
  return(a * X - b * Y * X)
}

dY_dt <- function(X, Y, c, d) {
  # X: number of prey
  # Y: number of predators
  # c: growth rate of predators from eating prey
  # d: death rate for predators
  
  return (c * X - d * Y)
}
```

```{r}
# parameters
a <- 5
b <- 1
c <- 1
d <- 0.2

state <- c(X = 2, Y = 2)

dt <- 0.01 # timestep - the smaller, the better
tmax <- 30 # the total time we want to numerically solve for
points <- tmax/dt # the number of data points in the simulation - add 1 so that we can start at t=0

# vectors to store values of X, Y, and t at each timestep:
X_vector <- numeric(points) # prey population size
Y_vector <- numeric(points) # predator population size
t_vector <- seq(0, tmax - dt, by = dt) # time vector

# initial condition
X0 <- 2
Y0 <- 2
X_vector[1] <- X0
Y_vector[1] <- Y0

X <- X0 # initialize variable X
Y <- Y0 # initialize variable Y
```

This is the right way to do it.

```{r}
for (i in 2:points) {
  # start at 2 because the initial state is at position 1
  
  # first calculate BOTH dX and dY
  dX <- dX_dt(X = X, Y = Y, a = a, b = b) * dt
  dY <- dY_dt(X = X, Y = Y, c = c, d = d) * dt
  
  # now update BOTH X and Y
  X <- X + dX 
  Y <- Y + dY
  X_vector[i] <- X
  Y_vector[i] <- Y
}
```

This is the wrong way.

```{r}
for (i in 2:points) {
  # start at 2 because the initial state is at position 1
  
  # calculate dX and then update X (wrong)
  dX <- dX_dt(X = X, Y = Y, a = a, b = b) * dt
  X < X + dX
  
  # calculate dY and then update Y - this will use the new value of X instead of the old one.
  dY <- dY_dt(X = X, Y = Y, c = c, d = d) * dt
  Y <- Y + dY
  
  X_vector[i] <- X
  Y_vector[i] <- Y
}
```

## Phase portraits in two dimensions

#### Challenge

What were the axes of the one-dimensional phase portraits we drew? What would the axes
of a phase portrait for the predator-prey system above be?

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Challenge solution

# The axis was N in the 1D version. 
# For a 2D system with variables x and y, the two axes would be x and y.
```

Continuing with the predator-prey example: instead of plotting our numerical trajectory as $X$ and 
$Y$ vs. $t$, we'll plot $Y$ vs. $X$: predator population size vs. prey population size. 

```{r}
ggplot(result) +
  geom_path(aes(x = X, y = Y, color = time)) # geom_line connects the dots in the wrong way - try it out and see
```

A phase portrait in two dimensions has two axes: one for each of the variables in the system.
Here, the two variables are $X$ and $Y$, prey and predators. We want to include the same 
information in this 2D phase portrait as in the 1D portrait: at minimum, we want to mark 
the fixed points and draw a **vector field**: arrows indicating in which direction the rate 
of change is for different values of $X$ and $Y$. 

We can also add other information, and in the plot above we haven't yet drawn arrows or
fixed points, but we have drawn a **trajectory** - the dots trace out what happens to $X$
and $Y$ over time starting from $X = 2$, $Y = 2$. Time is no longer an axis in the plot,
but it's still there, hidden in the path that the populations take. 

Comparing these two ways of plotting a trajectory, we can see that oscillations in time
look like circular motion in the phase portrait. The GIF below illustrates this.

![Predator-prey simulation](https://github.com/UofTCoders/rcourse/raw/master/predator-prey.gif)

### Drawing qualitative phase portraits by hand

Before we look at how to add more to phase portraits in R, let's practice the process by hand to
get familiar with it. Let's use the following two-dimensional system as an example. The two state
variables are $x$ (position) and $v$ (velocity), and this is a model of a mass attached to a 
spring. $dx/dt$ is the rate of change of position, and $dv/dt$ is the rate of change of velocity. 

$$\frac{dx}{dt} = v$$

$$\frac{dv}{dt} = -\omega^2 x$$

We want to draw a **vector field** in two dimensions to show how the system will evolve through time.
Our axes are $x$ and $v$. It doesn't matter which one is the vertical axis and which one is
horizontal, but let's put $x$ on the x-axis and $v$ on the y-axis. These variables aren't 
population sizes, so they can realistically be negative and non-integers. 

Next, we choose some pairs of $x$ and $v$ and evaluate both $dx/dt$ and $dv/dt$, drawing an
arrow at $(x,v)$ in the direction of the derivative. Let's also set $\omega = 1$ for convenience.
Let's start with $(0,0)$: both derivatives are 0, so there's no arrow. For $(0,1)$, $dx/dt = 1$
and $dv/dt = 0$, so we draw an arrow pointing horizontally in the $+x$ direction. Similarly for
$(1,0)$. For $(1,1)$, we draw an arrow that goes $1$ unit in the $x$ direction and $-1$ unit in
the $y$ direction. As we keep filling in this grid, we start to get a picture of how the system
can behave for different starting points of $x$ and $v$. 

This is analogous to plotting $dN/dt$ vs. $N$ and drawing arrows to the right where $dN/dt$ is
positive and arrows to the left when it's negative, except that now we have to consider that 
the rate of change is affecting both variables at the same time. 

#### Challenge

Define a function called `mass_spring` that uses the format required by `ode` to calculate 
and return $dx/dt$ and $dv/dt$. We will use this function later to plot a phase portrait in R.
Remember that the arguments for your function must be called `t`, `y`, and `parameters`. 

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Challenge solution

mass_spring <- function(t, y, parameters) {
  # calculates dx/dt and dy/dt for a predator-prey model
  
  # t: time at which to evaluate derivatives
  # y: vector of system variables (c(x, v))
  # parameters: vector of model parameters (c(omega))
    
  # the state vector y has two elements because we have two variables
  x <- y[1] # position
  v <- y[2] # velocity
  
  omega <- parameters[1]
    
  # calculate rate of change
  dx <- v
  dv <- -omega^2 * x
  
  # return rate of change
  return(list(c(dx, dv)))
}
```

### Using `phaseR` to draw phase portraits in R

`phaseR` is a package specifically for drawing phase portraits. It can automatically calculate 
and plot things like trajectories and vector fields. 

```{r}
library(phaseR)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?phaseR
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?flowField # the nice thing about this packages is that it takes functions in the same format as `ode`
```

Let's plot a vector field and some trajectories for the predator-prey model.

```{r}
# plot vector field: on a grid of points, plot an arrow in the direction of dx/dt and dy/dt
pp_flowField <- flowField(predator_prey, x.lim = c(0, 10), y.lim = c(0, 10),
                          parameters = c(a = 5, b = 1, c = 1, d = 0.2), # same parameters as before,
                          points = 15, # this is the density of grid points on which to plot arrows
                          system = 'two.dim', # 'two.dim' is default
                          add = FALSE)

# add trajectories
pp_trajectory <- trajectory(predator_prey, 
                            # y0 is a matrix where each row is pairs of (X, Y) 
                            y0 = matrix(c(1, 1, 8, 5, 2, 0, 0, 8), ncol = 2,
                                   byrow = TRUE), 
                            t.end = 20, # how far in time to calculate the trajectories
                            parameters = c(a = 5, b = 1, c = 1, d = 0.2), system = "two.dim")
```

#### Challenge

Use `phaseR` and the function `flowField` to make a phase portrait for the mass-spring system 
of differential equations. You will need to use the function you wrote in the previous challenge.
Is there a fixed point, and if so, where do you think it is?

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# Challenge solution

# plot vector field: on a grid of points, plot an arrow in the direction of dx/dt and dv/dt
mass_spring_flowField <- flowField(mass_spring, x.lim = c(-3,3), y.lim = c(-2,2),
                          parameters = c(omega = 0.5), 
                          points = 21, 
                          system = 'two.dim', # 'two.dim' is default
                          add = FALSE)

# add trajectories - not part of challenge, just for fun.
mass_spring_trajectory <- trajectory(mass_spring, 
                            # y0 is a matrix where each row is pairs of (X, Y) 
                            y0 = matrix(c(1, 1, 0, 1, 2, -1.5), ncol = 2,
                                 byrow = TRUE), 
                            t.end = 20, # how far in time to calculate the trajectories
                            parameters = c(omega = 0.5), 
                            system = "two.dim")
```

## Finding fixed points analytically (time permitting)

Up until now we've been plotting `r eq_dn_dt` vs. $N$ to find the fixed points of a system. 
But we can also solve `r eq_dn_dt` $=0$ analytically to find the fixed points. One advantage of
finding the fixed points analytically is that you can see how the fixed points depend on the
model parameters, whereas before we had to choose parameters in order to plot `r eq_dn_dt`
and find the fixed points qualitatively.

$$\frac{dN}{dt} = rN(1-\frac{N}{K})$$

First, we set `r eq_dn_dt` $=0$. 

$$0 = rN(1-\frac{N}{K})$$

Next, we find all the values of $N$ that satisfy this equation. If either $rN = 0$ or 
$1-\frac{N}{K} = 0$, the equation is satisfied. This means we have two fixed points, 
one at $N = 0$ (since $r \neq 0$) and the other at $N = K$. These are the same fixed 
points we found graphically last week. Notice that one of the fixed points depends on 
$K$, but that neither of the fixed points depend on $r$. 

#### Challenge

Find the fixed point(s) of the following differential equation: 

$$\frac{dx}{dt} = x^2 - 1$$

   - First find the fixed points analytically on paper.
   - Plot $\frac{dx}{dt}$ vs. $x$ for $x$ ranging from $-2$ to $2$ in $0.1$ increments.
   - Sketch a phase portrait. Are the fixed point(s) stable or unstable?

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# Challenge solution

# fixed points are x = 1, x = -1

library(ggplot2)

x_seq <- seq(-2, 2, by = 0.1)

dx_dt <- x_seq^2 - 1

qplot(x_seq, dx_dt) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0))
```
