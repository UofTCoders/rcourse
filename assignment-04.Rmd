1. Consider the differential equation $\frac{dx}{dt} = x(1-x)$.

(a) Use R to plot $\frac{dx}{dt}$ vs. $x$ for $-1 \le x \le 2$.

(b) Sketch a one-dimensional phase portrait on paper. Mark the direction of the derivative in each region with arrows and label the fixed points as "stable" or "unstable".

(c) Qualitatively graph $x$ vs. $t$ for the following three initial conditions: $x_0 = -0.5$, $x_0 = 0.5$, and $x_0 = 1.5$. What happens as $t$ becomes large in each case?

2. Generally, as population size increases, a population will experience a decreased growth rate due to greater competition for resources. This is a negative density-dependent growth rate, an example of which is the logistic model. The Allee effect introduces positive density dependence, where increases in population size result in increased growth rates over a certain range of population sizes. The Allee effect can be incorporated into the logistic growth equation as follows:

$$\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right)\left(\frac{N-A}{K}\right)$$

Here $r$ represents the growth rate of the population, $K$ is a carrying capacity, and $A$ is a critical size above which the total growth rate is positive.

(a) Take $r=1$, $A=10$, and $K=50$. Use R to plot $\frac{dN}{dt}$ vs. $N$ for $0 \le N \le 60$. For which values of $N$ is the growth rate ($\frac{dN}{dt}$) positive or negative?

(b) Sketch a one-dimensional phase portrait on paper, leaving $A$ and $K$ as variables (i.e. without choosing values for $A$ and $K$, but with $0 \le A < K$). Mark the direction of the derivative in each region with arrows and label the fixed points as "stable" or "unstable".

(c) Use R to plot the per capita growth rate ($\frac{1}{N}\frac{dN}{dt}$) vs. $N$ for this model of the Allee effect and for the logistic growth model: $\frac{dN}{dt} = rN(1-\frac{N}{K})$. What do you notice about the density ($N$) dependence of the growth rate in each case? What happens to the Allee effect as $A$ decreases? Plot curves for $A=0$ and a few values of $A>0$. The parameter $A$ controls the strength of the Allee effect: for $A > 0$, the Allee effect is said to be strong, and for $A=0$, the Allee effect is weak. What will happen to a population experiencing a strong Allee effect if the population size falls below $A$? 

(d) Describe two biological situations in which you might expect to see an Allee effect (either weak or strong). 

3. Consider the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model:

$$\frac{dx}{dt} = x - \alpha y x$$

$$\frac{dy}{dt} = \beta y x - \delta y$$

where $x$ and $y$ are the prey and predator population sizes, respectively. $\alpha$ is the rate at which prey are killed by predators, $\beta$ is the rate at which predators grow by consuming prey, and $\delta$ is the death rate of predators.

(a) Sketch a two-dimensional phase portrait on paper ($y$ vs. $x$) with $\delta = 1$ and $\alpha =\beta = 0.5$. Sketch in the nullclines and mark the fixed point(s).

(b) Referring to your phase portrait, describe or sketch possible trajectories for the two populations in time. What feature(s) of these trajectories would be noticeable in experiments, regardless of the true parameters of the system? 

(c) The model considered in parts (a) and (b) included a Type I functional response: the predator increases linearly with prey population size. A more realistic response takes into account that predators can't consume prey infinitely quickly and so as the prey increases, the predators will get proportionally less benefit. Re-write the differential equations in (a), replacing $\beta y x $ with a Type II functional response: $\beta y x / (1+ \beta h x )$.
